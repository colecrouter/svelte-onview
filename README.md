# sveltersect

sveltersect is an ultra-lightweight library that lets you effortlessly animate elements when they come in/out of view. Use built-in Svelte transitions, CSS classes, or custom callbacks to create stunning effects with minimal effort.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -D sveltersect
```

## Usage

sveltersect has three main ways to animate elements:

1. **Svelte Transitions**

Use the built-in Svelte transitions. You can use any of the built-in transitions or create your own.

```svelte
<script>
  import { fade } from 'svelte/transition';
  import { reveal } from 'sveltersect';
</script>
<div use:reveal={{ transition: { animation: fade, threshold: 0.3 } }}>
  This element will fade in when it enters the viewport and fade out when it exits.
</div>
```

sveltersect will automatically apply the correct transition in each state; mount, unmount, enter, and exit.

2. **CSS Classes**

Prefer CSS? Simply pass a class (or classes) to tie it into the observer.

```svelte
<div use:reveal={{ class: 'fade-in-out', transition: { threshold: 0.5 } }}>
  This element will fade in when it enters the viewport and fade out when it exits.
</div>
<style>
  div {
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;
  }
  .fade-in-out {
    opacity: 1;
  }
</style>
```

â€”just remember to set the initial state in your CSS.

3. **Custom Callbacks**
   You can also pass callback functions, and trigger your own side-effects.

```svelte
<div use:reveal={{ callbacks: { 
  enter: () => console.log('enter'),
  exit: () => console.log('exit')
}}>
  This element will log to the console when it enters and exits the viewport.
</div>
```

Lastly, you can also use separate parameters for entering and exiting transitions:

```svelte
<div use:reveal={{
  in: { animation: fly, params: { y: 100 }, threshold: 0.5 },
  out: { animation: fade, params: { duration: 200 }, threshold: 0.5 }
}}>
  This element will fade in when it enters the viewport and fade out when it exits.
</div>
```
